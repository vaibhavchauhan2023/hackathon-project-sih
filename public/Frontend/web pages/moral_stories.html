            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Squeaky the squirrel was the best nut-finder in the forest. He had a huge pile of acorns but never shared. One day, a big storm washed away everyone's food. All the other animals were sad and hungry. Seeing their faces, Squeaky felt a pang in his heart. He rolled his giant pile of nuts into the center of the forest for everyone. Sharing his treasure made him feel warmer and happier than hoarding it ever did. He learned that being rich isn't about how much you have, but how much you give.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">A little fox was given the job of carrying water in two pots. One pot was perfect, the other had a crack. Every day, he'd arrive with one full pot and one half-full pot. The cracked pot felt sad and useless. But the clever fox told it, "Look behind you!" On the side of the path where the cracked pot leaked, beautiful flowers grew, watered every day. The fox explained, "Your little flaw helped make the world more beautiful." It showed that even our imperfections can have a wonderful purpose.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Barnaby the rabbit was the fastest in the woods and he never let anyone forget it. He challenged Sheldon the tortoise to a race. Barnaby zoomed ahead and, sure he would win, took a nap. But Sheldon just kept going, step by steady step. He didn't stop to brag or to rest. He just focused on the finish line. When Barnaby woke up, Sheldon was already there, munching on a strawberry. Sheldon taught everyone that being slow and steady is sometimes better than being fast and flashy.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Beatrice was the smallest bee in the hive and felt she wasn't important. The bigger bees would collect lots of nectar. All Beatrice could do was carry tiny grains of pollen from one flower to another. She felt useless. But the Queen Bee explained, "My dear, without you spreading the pollen, none of the flowers would grow, and there would be no nectar for anyone!" Beatrice learned that even the smallest bee has a hugely important job to do.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Barnaby the bear was big and strong. When he wanted honey, he would just grunt, "HONEY!" The bees would get scared and hide. When he wanted berries, he'd shout, "BERRIES!" The birds would fly away. One day, a polite little mouse asked, "Please, may I have a crumb?" and everyone shared. Barnaby saw this and tried. "Please," he rumbled softly, "may I have some honey?" The bees were so happy with his manners, they shared their sweetest honey. The magic words made everyone happy.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Two goats, Gus and Greta, met in the middle of a very narrow bridge. Both were too proud to back up. "I go first!" said Gus. "No, I go first!" said Greta. They locked horns and pushed, but neither could move. They were stuck. Finally, Greta had an idea. "If I lie down," she said, "you can carefully walk over me." Gus agreed. By working together instead of fighting, they both were able to cross the bridge safely. Cooperation was much smarter than pride.</p>
