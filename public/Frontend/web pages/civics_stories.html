            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Maya loved her neighborhood park, but she was sad to see candy wrappers
                and empty bottles littering the grass. "This is a job for a superhero!" she declared. She put on a cape
                (a red towel) and made a sign that said "Captain Cleanup." She picked up the trash and put it in the
                bin. The next day, her friends saw her and joined in. Soon, the whole park was sparkling clean. Maya
                realized you don't need superpowers to be a heroâ€”you just need to care for the world around you.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">At the ice cream truck, all the kids were pushing and shoving. It was
                chaos! But Leo the Lion remembered what his grandpa taught him. He stood straight and formed the start
                of a line. "Let's be Line-Up Lions!" he roared politely. A little penguin waddled behind him, then a
                giraffe. Soon, everyone was in a neat line. It was faster, fairer, and much friendlier. Being patient
                and orderly meant everyone got their ice cream without any fuss. It was a sweet victory for good
                manners!</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">In the town library lived a little mouse named Squeakert. He loved
                stories, but he knew the library had one important rule: be quiet so everyone can read. When two young
                puppies started barking and chasing a ball, Squeakert bravely went up to them. He put a tiny finger to
                his lips and pointed at all the people trying to enjoy their books. The puppies understood. They took
                their ball outside and came back later to read a book quietly. Squeakert knew that respecting quiet
                places makes them nice for everyone.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">A barren patch of dirt in the middle of town made everyone feel gloomy. A
                group of kids, calling themselves the "Seed Starters," decided to do something. They brought seeds from
                homeâ€”sunflowers, marigolds, and daisies. They watered the patch every day. Soon, tiny green shoots
                appeared, and then beautiful, colorful flowers. Their small act of planting something beautiful turned a
                sad, forgotten corner into a cheerful garden for the whole neighborhood to enjoy.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Mrs. Gable was a kind, elderly lady who had trouble carrying her heavy
                groceries. One day, Sam and his sister Lily saw her struggling. "Can we help you?" Lily asked. Together,
                the three of them easily carried the bags to her house. Mrs. Gable was so thankful, she gave them
                freshly baked cookies. Sam and Lily learned that being a good neighbor means looking out for others and
                offering a helping hand when you see someone in need. The cookies were just a bonus!</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Mama Duck was trying to lead her ducklings across a busy street, but cars
                kept zooming by. It was very dangerous! Just then, a school crossing guard saw them. He blew his whistle
                and held up his big red "STOP" sign. All the cars stopped. Mama Duck and her ducklings could then cross
                the street safely. The story shows why traffic rules and people like crossing guards are so
                importantâ€”they keep everyone, even little ducklings, safe from harm.</p>
