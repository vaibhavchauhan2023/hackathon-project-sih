            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Aarav found an old clay cart in his grandma's attic. When he spun its wheels, his room swirled and he landed in a bustling city thousands of years ago‚Äîthe Indus Valley Civilization! He saw people making beautiful pottery and houses made of neat bricks. A girl showed him how they used seals with animal pictures to sign their names. Aarav realized that even without phones or TVs, kids long ago played, created, and lived in amazing, clever cities.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">A young boy named Thomas Edison was always asking "why?". He was so curious, he once tried to hatch eggs by sitting on them! While that didn't work, his curiosity led him to create amazing things. His most famous invention was the lightbulb. He tried thousands of times before he got it right. His story teaches us that it's okay to fail, as long as you never, ever give up on your bright ideas!</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Orville and Wilbur Wright dreamed of flying. They watched birds for hours. A little sparrow named Pip (no relation!) watched them back. He saw them build gliders and fail over and over. But they never gave up. One cold day, their rickety plane, the 'Flyer', lifted off the ground! It only flew for 12 seconds, but Pip the sparrow chirped his heart out. He was their very first fan. He knew he had just seen history take flight.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">In Italy, a long time ago, a boy named Leonardo da Vinci had a magic sketchbook. Whatever he saw, he could draw perfectly. But he didn't just draw what he saw‚Äîhe drew what he imagined! His book was filled with sketches of flying machines, diving suits, and robotic knights. People thought his ideas were crazy. But he was just dreaming of the future. Many of his "crazy" ideas are things we have for real today!</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Before the printing press, books had to be copied by hand. It took years to make just one! Then, a man named Johannes Gutenberg invented a machine that was like magic. It could print hundreds of pages in a single day. Suddenly, stories and ideas could travel the world faster than ever before. It was like he invented a way to share thoughts, opening up a whole new world of learning for everyone.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">In India, there was a brave queen named Rani Lakshmibai. She loved her kingdom of Jhansi and its people. When powerful enemies tried to take it away, she didn't hide. She rode into battle on her horse, with her son tied safely to her back. She was a fearless warrior and a symbol of courage. Her story reminds us that true strength comes from the heart, and that you should always stand up for what you believe in, no matter how great the challenge.</p>
