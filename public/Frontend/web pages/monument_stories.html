            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Priya was visiting the beautiful Taj Mahal. As she touched its cool, white marble wall, she heard a soft whisper. It wasn't the wind! An ancient story-sprite told her a secret: the emperor who built it, Shah Jahan, made it as a promise to his queen, Mumtaz. The sprite said that every carving and jewel holds a memory of their love. Priya left that day knowing the Taj Mahal wasn't just a building, but the world's biggest and most beautiful love letter.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Mei was flying a kite on the Great Wall of China. The wall snaked over the mountains like a giant stone dragon. A wise old eagle told her a legend: the wall was built to protect the land, and a friendly dragon spirit sleeps within the stones. The dragon only wakes up if someone shows great courage. Mei helped a little boy who had fallen, and for a moment, she thought she saw one of the wall's towers give her a happy, wobbly wink. The dragon was proud of her!</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">In Pisa, Italy, there's a tower that has been leaning for hundreds of years. A little bird named Rico knew its secret. The tower wasn't falling; it was trying to scratch a spot on its base that had been ticklish since 1173! Tourists taking funny pictures looked like they were trying to help. Rico would sometimes land on the ticklish spot, and he swore he could hear the old tower give a happy sigh of relief. He was the only one who knew the tower wasn't clumsy, just comfy!</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Omar was exploring the Great Pyramid of Giza. He noticed that the tunnels inside weren't random; they pointed to specific spots in the sky. An old ghost of a pharaoh appeared, shimmering in the torchlight. He explained that the pyramids were built to be a map to the stars. "We believed our kings would travel to the stars to watch over us," he whispered. Omar realized the pyramid wasn't just a tomb, but a giant, stone spaceship for the soul, ready for a journey across the universe.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">When night falls on the Colosseum in Rome, the ghosts of gladiators come out to play. But they don't fight! A little Roman mouse named Maximus knew their secret. They played epic games of hide-and-seek among the ancient arches and held chariot races using beetles as horses. They were the best of friends. They had to be tough in their time, but now they just wanted to have fun. Maximus would often share his crumbs of cheese with the champion ghost, Flamma.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Every night, when Paris was asleep, the Eiffel Tower had a secret. It could stretch! Very slowly, its iron lattice would reach higher and higher, trying to touch the stars it admired all day. It dreamed of being a rocket ship. A little owl who lived at the top would hoot encouragement. "A little higher tonight, Gustave!" she'd say. The tower never quite made it, but it loved stretching its legs and being the tallest dreamer in the whole city.</p>
