            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Mr. Hoot, the class's toy owl mascot, was gone! The only clue was a trail of sunflower seeds leading to the window. Lily, the class detective, noticed that Sammy the hamster's cage was open. She followed the seed trail outside and found Sammy sleeping under a bush, with Mr. Hoot tucked beside him. Sammy just wanted a friend for his nap! The mystery was solved, and Sammy got a new tiny teddy to sleep with instead.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Mom had baked twelve cookies. Now there were only ten. Who was the thief? Tom and his sister Mia looked for clues. They found a few crumbs near the back door and a small, muddy paw print on the floor. Just then, their dog, Buster, trotted in with chocolate on his whiskers and a very happy tail. He had been burying his cookie treasure in the garden! Buster was a cookie thief, but he was too cute to be mad at.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">While walking on the beach, Chloe found a beautiful conch shell. When she held it to her ear, she didn't hear the ocean; she heard a faint, tinkling song. She was sure it was magic! Her grandpa looked at the shell and smiled. He showed her a tiny, hidden music box tucked deep inside. It was a gift he had made for her grandma years ago and lost on this very beach. The shell wasn't magic, but finding it certainly felt like it.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Someone was leaving nice notes in people's lockers. "You have a great smile!" one said. "You're a super friend!" said another. Everyone wanted to know who the phantom was. Liam decided to watch the hallways. He saw the new, shy kid, Alex, quickly slipping a note into a locker when no one was looking. Liam didn't tell everyone; instead, he slipped a note into Alex's locker that said, "Thanks for being so kind!"</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Dad was painting the fence white, but when he came back from lunch, there was a big purple splotch on it! Who was the culprit? Maya looked around. She saw the neighbor's cat, Indigo, washing a purple paw. Then she saw a tipped-over pot of purple petunias next to the fence. Indigo must have knocked over the flowers and then walked on the wet fence. The cat was the purple painter!</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">An old oak tree in the park was said to whisper secrets. Ben and his friends listened closely. They heard a rustling, crinkling sound. Was it treasure? They searched around the base of the tree. Tucked in a hollow was a nest of baby squirrels, playing with a shiny potato chip bag they had found. The tree wasn't whispering a secret; it was just full of noisy, playful squirrels! That was a treasure of a different kind.</p>
